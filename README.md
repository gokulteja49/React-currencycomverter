This project is an enhanced version of my previous Currency Converter web application. The primary goal of this app is to allow users to convert currencies based on real-time exchange rates.

Features:
Real-Time Conversion: Fetches live currency conversion rates using a reliable API.
Flag Display: Shows corresponding flags for each currency for easy identification.
Predefined Currency Selection: Defaults to INR (India) and USD (USA) currencies with flag icons and names displayed.
Responsive UI: User-friendly interface with a modern design and smooth transitions.
State Management: Uses Redux for efficient state management of currency selection and conversion rates.
Technologies Used:
Frontend: React.js, CSS (for styling), Axios (for API calls), Redux (for state management).
API: Currency conversion rates API.
How It Works:
The application provides dropdown menus to select the source and target currencies. Upon inputting an amount, it fetches the conversion rate from an API and displays the result along with corresponding currency flags. If no currency is selected, it defaults to INR and USD.

This version builds upon my previous currency conversion app, with improvements in the user interface, error handling, and better state management using Redux.
